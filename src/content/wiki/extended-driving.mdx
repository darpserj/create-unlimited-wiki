# Extended Driving

Changing this value changes the maximum angle between track edges that can be recognized as a connection, effectively allowing for more "cursed" turns to be driven over. Lower values correlate with looser restrictions. Setting extendedDriving to 0 may cause some issues with trains turning on curves that they shouldn't; hence, I recommend setting this to a value slightly above 0, such as 0.01.
